        <h2>From <em>ZERO</em> to <storng>HERO</storng></h2>
        <p>Born in Sombor, Serbia during a literal civil war, the odds were always going to be stacked agains Nikola Jokic. Growing up where he did, it would be hard for anyone to find something worth wokring towards. Thanks to the help and support of his family and those around him, Nikola Jokic was able to find his purpose in playing basketball.</p>
        <p>After playing overseas in Serbia, Jokic set his eyes on the National Basketball Association, where he was drafted 41st overall in 2014 by the Denver Nuggets. 9 years later and "The Joker" is a 5x All-NBA, 5x All-Star, 2x League MVP, and most recently, a Finals MVP and NBA Champion. No one could have ever seen Jokic coming unless you were extremeley close to him. He faced tons of hatred from NBA consumers as well as sports media figures who would stop at nothing to harm his image. Jokic never cared about any of that however, he just played the game loved and dominated like no other.</p>
