        <h1>Welcome to my page of Amusement</h1>
      <p>Here I will showcase three pages from the web that I find quite amusing.</p>
        <h2>JetPunk</h2>
      <p>The first website is not necessarily one that brings laughter to my life, but it is a website that I find myslef on almost every day. Here you can take quizzes and play minigames about almost any topic you can think of. I spend most of my time on the site taking quizzes about <strong>basketball</strong> or <strong>marvel</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Hacker Typer</h2>
      <p>Ever wanted to feel like a hacker? This website gives you that "movie hacker" feel that you have been missing from your life. I discovered the site in high school and I go back to it from time to time when I need my hacker fix.</p>

        <h2>Eel Slap</h2>
      <p>This site does pretty much exaclty what you think it does. It allows the user to drag their mouse across the screen, simultaneously slapping the man that appears on screen across the face with a full eel!</p>
